# KdMP
This script Calculates the Kd of receptor-ligand binding from Mass photometry counts. 

It is recommended to make measurements in a concentration range close to the expected Kd. 

Run the script by: 
> Python KdMP.py

And follow the prompts.

The unit of the Kd will be the same as the given starting concentrations. The default is micromolar.
